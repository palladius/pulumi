This repo contains a number of folders with self-living examples.

* üçπ[First (python-gcp-cloudbuild-auto-trigger)](https://github.com/palladius/pulumi/tree/main/examples/python-gcp-cloudbuild-auto-trigger)
  is about creating a trigger on GCP Cloud Build (in Python) which automatically launches pulumi up of its own.
  So hopefully whenever you do a commit, it will just launch a `pulumi up` :)
