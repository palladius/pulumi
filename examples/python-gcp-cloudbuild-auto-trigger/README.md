* Article: https://medium.com/@palladiusbonton/setting-cloudbuild-with-pulumi-in-python-330e8b54b2cf

## INSTALL

* Install Pulumi
* branch this code in a repo you own (you need to be able to commit to that repo).
* Connect with Cloud Build - unfortunately we can't automate it just yet.
* Finally configure and run this code.

## Pulumi setup

Set up your env vars:

```
# GCP stuff
pulumi config set gcp:project your-gcp-project-id # Your project id. I cant do it for you :)
pulumi config set gcp:region <your-region> # e.g us-west1
pulumi config set gcp:zone   <your-zone> # e.g us-west1-b
# Module-related stuff
pulumi config set app_name 'My app - you can change me' # beware to weird chars, this goes into GCP descriptions
pulumi config set app_name_lower 'mycloudbuilddemo'
pulumi config set favourite_color 'fuxia'
```

## Results

When it works, you should see this:
