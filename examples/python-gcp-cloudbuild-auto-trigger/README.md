Currently 🧹 Work in progress

* Article: https://medium.com/@palladiusbonton/setting-cloudbuild-with-pulumi-in-python-330e8b54b2cf

## INSTALL

* Install Pulumi
* branch this code in a repo you own (you need to be able to commit to that repo).
* Connect with Cloud Build - unfortunately we can't automate it just yet.
* Finally configure and run this code.

When it works, you should see this:

![Cloud Build works](images/cloudbuild-works.png "Cloud Build works")
